I suggest to go through these two video before getting into these notes 
while while first video the time zone is from 1 hour 30 minut to 1 hour 56 minutes

<a href = "https://youtu.be/r-uOLxNrNk8?t=5387"> Free code camp </a>     (first video)
<a href = "https://youtu.be/1qz7qUM6yUI?si=GYdiMGULbmzXtJqc"> Numpy by intellipaat </a> (second video)

you can watch these two video at 1.25 playback speed if it feels lag
